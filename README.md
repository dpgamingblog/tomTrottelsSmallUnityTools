## Trees On Terrain Remover

Removes trees on terrain within a specified radius

Saves trees on startup and restores them afterwards

Add it as Component to a GameObject. 

The position of the GameObject is the center.

If you select the GameObject a Gismo Sphere shows the radius visually.

Call the method RemoveTreesInRadius *or* change the value removeTreesInRadius in the Inspector

Attention : Make a backup of your terrain, just in case, and do not use it in Editor Mode (yet).
